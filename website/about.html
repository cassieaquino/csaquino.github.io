                    <h5>Hello, I'm Cassandra Aquino, but call me Cassie!</h5>
                    <p>I'm a junior at UC Berkeley studying computer science and cognitive science!
                        Currently, I am interested in how technology can be developed for social good. 
                        As technology is being built to make our lives easier and make things more accessible
                        for others, it's important to keep those goals in mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But during my free time, I enjoy checking out new boba shops, 
                        watching/playing soccer, taking pictures and creating music playlists. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Born and raised in Southern California, I am still figuring out the bay area, so feel free to reach out with 
                        some fun recommendations that I can check out during my time here in Northern California!
